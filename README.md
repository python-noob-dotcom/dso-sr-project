# dso-sr-project

This project aims to stimulate airborne targets, e.g. commercial airlines, fighter jets and classify them, using machine learning
Ideally, the stimulation would also be done under a machine learning network with supervised learning using real data (another machine learning problem)

But it is increasingly likely that such a Generator Antagonist network will likely not be finished when the project due deadline comes.
